# Project 0

This is the solution for project0 of Web programming with python and javascript 

For this project we were supposed to choose an optional project and make it using HTML, CSS and SASS.

I myself decided to make a short CV template for myself and now I can deploy it online then whenever anyone ask for my CV I will give them link of my online CV which is much better, cleaner and reliable than papper documented CVs.

This project has four pages which are home page (about), education page, experience page and contact page which are meaning ful from thier names.
